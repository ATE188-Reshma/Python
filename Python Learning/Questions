1)Why Python is Dynamically typed Programming Language?
No need to define DataType.
Same variable's value can be changed 'n' no.of times.
But, String values can't be changed. 

2)String is mutable or immutable?
  String is immutable.
The String methods won't change the existing string value. It can only reassigned.
 Ex: name="reshma"
 name.upper()
 print(name) # O/P: reshma
 
 FOR INTEGER: 
 a=1
 a+=1
 print(a) # O/P: 2
 Now, a value changed from the existing value. These are mutable.
  
3) Reversal of a String

4) As positional argument must appear before any keyword argument.
